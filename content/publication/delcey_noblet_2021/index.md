abstract: This article offers a historical analysis of the contributions of U.S. interwar
  agricultural economics to the economics of information. Concerned with improving
  the circulation of information on agricultural markets, agricultural economists
  analyzed the relationship between agentsâ€™ information and the behavior of prices
  on agricultural commodity exchanges, thus anticipating modern debates on informational
  efficiency. We show that these debates were part of a more general context of agricultural
  market reform led by the U.S. administration to improve the production and diffusion
  of economic information. We argue that such reforms were a prerequisite for theoretical
  discussions on information, and established institutional tools that are still active
  today, such as the USDA market news service.
