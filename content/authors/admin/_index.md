I am a historian of economics. My research aims at tracing the evolution of economic thought about financial markets through the 20th century. I use qualitative data (content analysis, private and administrative archives, oral history) and, more recently, quantitative data (bibliometric analysis and text mining). 

I completed a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Paris I Panthéon Sorbonne in 2021; I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University. My published research deal with the origins and emergence of financial economics and the concept of market efficiency. I work currently on three projects: (a) a political discussion of green finance regulation, (b) a history of the concept of bubbles, with a special focus on the tulip-mania, (c) building quantitative tools for measuring the impact of business schools on contemporary economics.
